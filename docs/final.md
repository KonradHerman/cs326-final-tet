If they are a match, the user will be able to continue to use the website. If they are not a match, the user is routed to the login page. After 2 hours the session ID is set to -1 and no longer valid. The user will be required to login again and will receive a new session ID.

## URL Routes/Mappings

URL Routes/Mappings: A final up-to-date table of all the URL routes that your application supports and a short description of what those routes are used for. You should also indicate any authentication and permissions on those routes.

## Authentication
Authentication/Authorization: A final up-to-date description of how users are authenticated and any permissions for specific users (if any) that you used in your application. You should mention how they relate to which UI views are accessible.

In order to access the website, users must login first. If a user does not currently have an account they can create one from the create-account.html page. 

Create Account:

When creating a new account, each user is required to input a unique username that currently is not in use and a unique email that currently is not in use. The user then puts in a password (multiple users can have the same password). The user information is then sent to the server and the password is hashed in order to protect users.

Login: 

The user must input their username and password to login. The user inputted username and password are sent to the server for authentication. The server obtains the user's information from the primary key of their username. If the username is not found, then a "incorrect username or password" message is sent to the client which displays the message to the user. If the usename is found, then the inputted password is compared with the hashed password. If the inputted password is not a match then the server sends a "incorrect username or password" message to the client which displays it to the user.

Sessions:

Every user has a session ID. When an account is first created this value is sent to -1. Whenever a user logs in to their account, the server sets their session ID to a random value which is stored in the server database. The server then hashes the session id and responds to the client with the session ID. The username and session ID are stored locally using sessionStorage. Hashing the session ID makes it more difficult to access the website without a valid account. After 2 hours, the user's session ID is set to -1 and their session has expired. The user must login again in order to refresh their session. Since the session ID is stored using sessionStorage, after a user closes their browser, they will have to login again. 

## Division of Labor
Division of Labor: A breakdown of the division of labor for each team member â€” that is, saying who did what, for the entire project. Remember that everyone is expected to contribute roughly equally to each phase of the project. We expect to see similar numbers and kinds of GitHub commits by each student.

## Conclusion
Conclusion: A conclusion describing your teamâ€™s experience in working on this project. This should include what you learned through the design and implementation process, the difficulties you encountered, what your team would have liked to know before starting the project that would have helped you later, and any other technical hurdles that your team encountered.
