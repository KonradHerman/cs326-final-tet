4. Innovative Idea

    Our application can be viewed much like a Tinder or Facebook Groups but for in person / online board games. You set up a profile with Games you have and games you want to play. You can also search for specific games. When doing so, users that would like to play, whether or not they own the game will show up in search, sorted by distance. You can message people either through discord or the website itself to set up games. Setting up the games will be left mostly to the users themselves, we may implement a groups feature where users can create a group of people they have found to play a particular game. Zoom or discord links can be sent as well in case people want to play a game remotely which is becoming more relevant and realistic with the current crisis. The point of our application is connecting users who enjoy the same games.

5. Important Components

    a) a login component that allows users to login to a unique account. Each account will be bound to an email and their password will be protected on the server.
    b) A profile component that allows users to list games they have and games they want to play
    c) A search feature for finding players with interests in the same game
    d) a component that allows users to friend each other and communicate and interact with friends
    
6. Important Data
    The website is a place where different users can connect to play in person board games. This means we need an account for every user. Each account includes important data: username, email, password, unique user ID, geo-location (town), list of games they play and games they own. The only public data will be username and list of games they play/own. The geo-location will be provided by the user and they only have to give their town name, not street address.
